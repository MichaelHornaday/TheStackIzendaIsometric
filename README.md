# TheStackIzendaIsometric

## Purpose

Just a fun animated explanation of Izenda's three tiers using the GreenSock JS animation library.

## To Use

I apologize that the HTML file is huge, but all you need to do to run it is serve it up from a web server.

Everything about the explainer is all in that one file.
